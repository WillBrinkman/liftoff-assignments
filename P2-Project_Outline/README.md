## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This project will provide a way for a local nonprofit who repairs / refurbished donated used bikes to collect data on what maintenance has been done to a bike.  When a form is filled out once a bike is refubished, assumed costs per part and maintenance hours will be attached to the bikes id.  This will help the company track costs with more finite detail and aid them in more efficiently utilizing their time and money.  This project will also give prospective buyers information on what maintenance has been done to a bike to aid their confidence that their bike will last.
 
### Features
 
User login: users will be able to login so that their work (rebuilding a bike) can be tagged with their name.  Authorization levels will also exist to gate users from access to search functions and reassigning preset costs.
 
Search: Managers / Administrators will be able to search through the refurbished bike database by id or with filters like bike size.
 
Bike building form: a table with checklists and scrollbar lists to mark parts and maintenance performed on the bike.
 
Cost Adjustment form:  a page where the administrator can adjust the assigned price to parts (used or new) or labor hours for instillation / maintenance.
